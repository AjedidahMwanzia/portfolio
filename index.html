                      <h3> A sneak peak into my fabulous life</h3>
                      <p>I am Ajedidah Mwanzia a graduate in BBIT  from The techincal university of Kenya. <br>
                         I also posses professional certifications in different areas of specialization <br> 
                         These are CCNA,Gsuite Adminstration and cloud associate certificate.During <br> 
                         my free time i enjoy modelling ,reading especially science related books, watching  <br>
                         movies syfy to be specific they expand my mind to the power of imagination and travelling .<br>
                         I also find joy in mentoring the highschool kids through Truth Mentorship Society.  
                        </p> 

                        <p>Enrolling for programming class for me is both personal and growth related. <br> I lost my bestfriend who was senior programmer at cellulant during the dusit attack in 2019.  <br>I'd say back then he tried pushing me to be a programmer but at the moment I wasn't ready. <br> Me being able to do this now is an honour of their memory. I have also <br> always desired to work for google,apple or microsoft and acquiring the skills in programming <br> is one step closer to achieving that dream .Finally i'd like to also work on personal projects <br> that i have been meaning to do but couldn't due to being short of the necessary skills.  </p>
