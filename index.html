                      <p>I am Ajedidah Mwanzia a graduate in BBIT  from The Techincal university of Kenya. <br>
                         I have also acquired professional certifications in different areas of specialization <br> 
                         These include: CCNA,Gsuite Adminstration and cloud associate certificate.During <br> 
                         my free time I enjoy modelling ,reading especially neuroscience/science related books, watching  <br>
                         movies syfy to be specific they open me up to the power of imagination and travelling .<br>
                         Lastly I find joy in mentoring the highschool students through the Truth Mentorship Society.  
                        </p> 

                        <p>Enrolling for programming class for me was both personal and growth related. <br> I lost my bestfriend who was senior programmer at cellulant during the dusit attack in 2019.  <br>I'd say back then he tried pushing me to be a programmer but at the moment I wasn't ready. <br> I being able to do this now is in honour of their memory. I have also always desired to work for  <br>Spacex,Tesla,NASA,Google or Microsoft and acquiring the skills in programming <br> is one step closer to achieving that dream .Finally i'd like to also work on personal projects <br> that i have been meaning to do but couldn't due to lack of the necessary skills.  </p>
